There is beauty in every one of us and my goal is to draw that beauty out, for each of my clients. This isn’t just hair and cosmetics, but the way my clients feel on the inside. When you create a stunning look for someone it really makes them feel great about themselves. My goal is to help people to see their true beauty. When one hears the word fashion, it can bring to mind ridiculous outfits on a runway stage. However, when I hear the word fashion, I think personal Style, Image, Trends, and Creativity. Everyone has their own sense of fashion and personal style that fits into their life."</p><cite>- Harmony</cite></blockquote></div></div></div></section><!-- bio section --><section id="section-bio"><div class="container"><div><p>Using her creative talents and her love for people, Harmony has developed a complex portfolio with over 15 years of experience in the industry. During that time she has worked to energize her career by becoming an American Board Certified Haircolorist and has partnered with Seattle Union Gospel Mission, The Taproot Theatre, Haircuts for Hope and many more. As an ACBH, she is an expert at color theory and able to apply this knowledge across all color brands.</p><p>As a L’ANZA Healing Artist, she has national recognition as a Product Knowledge Expert, skilled in the innovative use and application of all L’ANZA products and how they perform on all hair types and textures. Harmony is a passionate educator who brings excitement and enthusiasm to each salon class by setting out to inspire and mentor stylists. Growing and maintaining relationships with salons through continuous support has been an integral and rewarding part of her L’ANZA experience.</p><p>Harmony believes that style should not be allowed to go stale and has never allowed herself to be fooled into thinking that she has learned it all! Her focus on trends as an artist, searching for new ideas to add to her repertoire of color formulations, up-do’s, and full makeovers; has trained her to stay ahead of the latest fashion instead of falling into a monotonous groove.</p><p>Having a discerning eye and a vision for individual beauty, Harmony is striving to bring her vision into focus. Creating a beautiful style with her hands is a great passion for Harmony and when a person is in her chair she is inspired to bring that person to a higher plane of elegance and individuality. The finished product proves Harmony as an artist with a desire to make people feel good.</p></div></div></section><!-- Site Footer --><footer id="site-footer"><div class="container"><!-- Section contact --><section id="section-contact"><a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=2470 Westlake Ave N Seattle Wa 98109"><img class="icon" src="../assets/img/icon/address.svg"><span>2470 Westlake Ave N Seattle, WA 98109</span></a> <a href="mailto:harmony@harmonystyles.net"><img class="icon" src="../assets/img/icon/email.svg"><span>harmony@harmonystyles.net </span></a><a href="tel:2062559830"><img class="icon" src="../assets/img/icon/phone.svg"><span>(206) 255­-9830</span></a><p class="legal">Harmony Styles 2016 &copy All rights reserved</p><img class="logo-footer" src="../assets/img/logo.png"></section></div></footer><!-- Libraries --><script src="../assets/lib/jquery.js"></script><!-- Custom script --><script src="../assets/js/about/app.js"></script></body></html>
