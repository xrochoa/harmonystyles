All you need for deployment is in the 'dist' folder. It contains all the optimized and minified files including images.

The 'src' folder contains the unminified source code for any future changes. (not necessary)

--------------------
### EXPAND PORTFOLIO
--------------------

1) ADD IMAGES TO FOLDERS

save 2 'jpg' images with a width of 800px (normal and grayscale) to
dist > assets > img > portfolio

example: 'browns.jpg' and 'browns-gray.jpg'

2) ADD FUNCTIONALITY IN HTML FILE

open 
dist > portfolio > index.html 
and follow the instructions under '<!-- ADD IMAGES -->'

--------------------
### CHANGE PRICELIST
--------------------

open 
dist > services > index.html 
and follow the instructions under '<!-- CHANGE PRICES -->'

--------------------------------------
### CHANGE SOURCE CODE (NOT NECESSARY)
--------------------------------------

### Important: the next information is only necessary if you are planning to change the source code, which you probably won't since I setup everything for you previously.
